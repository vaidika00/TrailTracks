# TrailTracks
The road trip planner empowers users to seamlessly organize their journeys. 
Users can add destinations via a form, interactive map clicks (API-enabled), or other intuitive methods. Destinations can be easily rearranged, and the entire itinerary is visually displayed on a map, complete with details about distances and travel times between stops. 
A journey summary showcases total time, distance, and even fuel estimates for added convenience. To enhance user experience, all trip data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring it remains accessible even after navigating away from the page.
